            <h3>Armin Sešek</h3>
            <p class="col-xs-12">This was our first project. Since we are all music lovers, designing a website for
                violin professor was amazing experience for us. We had mutual love towards simplicity, so professor
                liked our first mockup. Armin wanted to present his work and biography through a website. The great
                challenge on this project was creating multiple web pages for different languages.
                Armin was lovely and very efficient client. Check out the recommendation he wrote for us!</p>

            <h3>Ceris udruženje</h3>
            <p class="col-xs-12">This was our second project - creating a website for Ceris group. Their main
                preoccupation is working with children and parental advising. Zorana, a psychotherapist and the founder
                of Ceris was amazing, very creative and positive client. She already had a vision how design should
                look.
                Great challenge for us on this project was using CSS animation for the first time, as Zorana wanted to
                have moving circles on her website. Although we had animation on the site, the design has remained
                simple.
                Through this website, Zorana, wanted to present work of Ceris group and their creative workshops.
                It was a great pleasure to cooperate with Zorana and after all she became a great friend to all members
                of Three and one design team.</p>

            <h3>Dea dia</h3>
            <p class="col-xs-12">This was a final project in school of web design Krojac, where we all enrolled and met
                each other.
                We worked on the site with five more students, colleagues (their names are in footer of Dea Dia
                website).
                Dea Dia is a famous club band from Belgrade. Lead vocals from the band, Svetlana and Juliana, presented
                us their idea. It was interesting to have a complete freedom in design, since the only directions we
                received were the colors the client had chosen.
                Adventure on this project was creating sound wave animation. You can check out this super-duper website
