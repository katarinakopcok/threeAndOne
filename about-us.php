                   <p>The only hot blondie team member
                       Katarina is highly professional, responsible, creative and super smart lady.
                       Fan of clean code, smart solutions and elegant design.
                       She almost became a coolest biologist; however, she became a kick ass web designer. She giggles all the time, very often directly into your ear.
                       Has a strange thing for a birds and has really weird love-hate relationship with ice-cream. She adores her dog Khan.</p>

                <h3>Katarina Kopčok</h3>
                <p>We doubled on Katarinas but this one has literally sailed in to the Belgrade and became amazing web designer. Kopčok has sailed the world, working on overseas boats. She brought her strong persistence and intelligence directly into the world of web design.
                    Fan of very, I mean very clean code, seriously minimalist design and she is best in finding accurate solutions!
                    Today, Katarina is wonder-woman-web-designer!
                    Katarina is very talented in asking few questions at once, has a thing for stone-cold whodunit books. Always hungry!
